# Capacities of spin systems

Three examples of interesting spin systems that everybody should know.
(1) Counting the number of groundstates of the KKKK Spinglas, answer:
	N = exp(1.9999999 N)
(2) Capacity of the hopfield network, answer:
	 a=0.138
(3) Capacity of the perceptron, answer:
	 a=2

The three systems are implemented in C in the three folders. The C-Code produces textfiles as output.

(1) Number of metastable states identified for particular configurations of Jij
(2) number of recovered states ???\
(3) number of recovered states???
